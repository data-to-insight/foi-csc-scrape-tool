        <h1>Childrens Services Freedom of Information Requests</h1>
        <p>This page provides a summary of Freedom of Information (FOI) requests made via the following sources:<br/>- <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com">WhatDoTheyKnow.com</a>.<br/>- Local authorities self-submitted records<br/><br/>By creating an automated/timely collated resource of FOI requests, we enable the potential to create the responses/development needed once and share it with other local authorities who receive similar requests.<br/>FOI requests are regularly submitted to multiple Local Authorities concurrently. By developing the required response query/data summary for one LA, we can distribute to any analyst who might otherwise be required to invest their own time into the required response.In order to use the pre-created response queries, local authorities will need to have deployed the Standard Safeguarding Dataset (SSD) <a href="https://data-to-insight.github.io/ssd-data-model/">Standard Safeguarding Dataset (SSD)</a>.Summary data shown below is scraped|aggregated from the above source(s) where FOI requests were considered to be within or relevant to the Children's Services Sector<br/>The raw data incl. any additional data points not fitting the below web summary is available to <a href="foi_requests.csv">download here</a>.</p>
        <p>Disclaimer:<br/>This summary is generated from publicly available data on the above listed sources<br/>Due to variations in both source(s) and request formatting, some data shown may be incomplete or inaccurate. You should confirm details before using in critical reportingFor further details and context, please refer to the original request links. <br/>Feedback or corrections are welcomed and can be sent via the project repository.</p>
        <p><p>Share details of an FOI received by your Local Authority to enable others:<br/>Email us with the request detail to add to this page: <a href="mailto:datatoinsight@gmail.com?subject=FOI%20details%20to%20add&body=Authority-Name:%20%3Cla-name%3E%0AAuthority-Code:%20%3Cla-code%3E%0ARequest-Title:%20%3Crequest-title%3E">Email D2I</a>.</p></p>
