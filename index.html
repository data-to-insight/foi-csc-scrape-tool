        <h1>Freedom of Information Requests - Childrens Services Remit</h1>
        <p><p>This page provides a summary of Freedom of Information (FOI) requests made via the following sources:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com">WhatDoTheyKnow.com</a></li><li>Local authority analyst-submitted records</li></ul>By creating an automated/timely collated resource of FOI requests, we enable the potential to create the responses/development needed once and share it with any other local authorities who receive similar requests.<br/>FOI requests are regularly submitted to multiple Local Authorities concurrently. By developing the required response query/data summary for one LA, we can then offer on-demand access to any analyst who might receive the same or similar request.Local authorities will need to have deployed the Standard Safeguarding Dataset (SSD) <a href="https://data-to-insight.github.io/ssd-data-model/">Standard Safeguarding Dataset (SSD)</a> and|or be a contributor to this FOI Network in order to download any of the pre-developed response queries from the <a href="https://github.com/data-to-insight/ssd-data-model/tree/main/tools-ssd_foi_requests">SSD tools repository</a>.<br/><br/>Summary data shown below is scraped|aggregated from the above source(s) where FOI requests were considered to be within or relevant to the Children's Services Sector<br/>The raw data incl. any additional data points not fitting the below web summary is available to <a href="https://github.com/data-to-insight/foi-scrape-tool/blob/main/foi_requests_summary.csv">download here</a>.</p>
        <p>Disclaimer:<br/>This summary is generated from publicly available data on the above listed sources<br/>Due to variations in both source(s) and request formatting, some data shown may be incomplete or inaccurate. You should confirm details before using in critical reporting.<br/>FOI requests into Scottish LAs, and some other related Organisations are included here for wider reference - with a view to potentially reducing this to LAs in England only at a later stage.<br/>To view further details about each request and context use the active FOI request links within the summary table. <br/></p>
        <p><p>LA colleagues are encouraged to share both <a href="mailto:datatoinsight@gmail.com?subject=FOI%20Feedback">feedback+corrections</a> or details of any related FOI received by your Local Authority to assist and enable colleagues elsewhere.<br/><a href="mailto:datatoinsight@gmail.com?subject=FOI%20details%20to%20add&body=Authority-Name:%20%3Cla-name%3E%0AAuthority-Code:%20%3Cla-code%3E%0ARequest-Title:%20%3Crequest-title%3E">Email us the FOI request summary detail</a> to contribute to this resource.</p></p>
