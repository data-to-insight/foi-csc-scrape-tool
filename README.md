# foi-scrape-tool 

## Initial problem brief
FOI requests submitted to local authorities by both private individuals and organisations are increasing in frequency. Though valid, the short time-frame requirements, and added overheads on already stretched (data)teams comes at a time-cost to those affected; more so where data data reporting is a small or single person team or that time is allocated on a part-time basis only.   

Is it possible to succinctly monitor submitted FOI requests? If yes, it might be possible to (pre-emptively) develop coded responses to these for open use or gain insights from patterns of requested data. This potentially allowing solutions/efforts to be shared collaboratively between impacted local authorities. Should LA colleagues wish, Analysts could also upload/submit both requests they have recieved directly, and|or their responses to recieved FOI requests. 



## 🚀 Features  

- Scrapes **details from FOI requests** from public sources   
- Outputs data in **structured CSV and HTML formats**  
- **Setup and execution automated** via `./setup.sh`  
- **Alpha release** – still in development, feedback welcome!  

## 🔧 Setup & Running
