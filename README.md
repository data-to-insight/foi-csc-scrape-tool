# FOI Whisper Network 
### FOI scrape tool(s) and related data processing 

## Initial problem brief
FOI requests submitted to local authorities by both private individuals and organisations are increasing in frequency. Though valid, the short time-frame requirements, and added overheads on already stretched (data)teams comes at a time-cost to those affected; more so where data data reporting is a small or single person team or that time is allocated on a part-time basis only.   

Is it possible to succinctly monitor submitted FOI requests? If yes, it might be possible to (pre-emptively) develop coded responses to these for open use or gain insights from patterns of requested data. This potentially allowing solutions/efforts to be shared collaboratively between impacted local authorities. Should LA colleagues wish, Analysts could also upload/submit both requests they have recieved directly, and|or their responses to recieved FOI requests. 

In combination with deployment of the [Standard Safeguarding Dataset (SSD)] (https://github.com/data-to-insight/ssd-data-model), where data points for Child Social Care are both known and standardised, it would be possible to codify FOI solutions that could be distributed|utilised by any LA who has received the same or similar FOI request(s). By accessing a central FOI resource within the SSD Git repo, analysts could save hours of unpredictable time and effort.
