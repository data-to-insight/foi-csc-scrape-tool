        <h1>Freedom of Information Requests - Children's Services Remit</h1>
        <p><p>This page provides a summary of Freedom of Information (FOI) requests made via the following sources:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com">WhatDoTheyKnow.com</a></li><li>Local authority analyst-submitted records</li></ul>By creating an automated/timely collated resource of FOI requests, we enable the potential to create the responses/development needed once and share it with any other local authorities who receive similar requests.<br/>FOI requests are regularly submitted to multiple Local Authorities concurrently. By developing the required response query/data summary for one LA, we can then offer on-demand access to any analyst who might receive the same or similar request.Local authorities will need to have deployed the Standard Safeguarding Dataset (SSD) <a href="https://data-to-insight.github.io/ssd-data-model/">SSD</a> and|or be a contributor to this FOI Network in order to download pre-developed response queries from the <a href="https://github.com/data-to-insight/ssd-data-model/tree/main/tools-ssd_foi_requests">SSD tools repository</a>.<br/><br/>Summary data below is aggregated from the above source(s) where FOI requests were relevant to the Children's Services Sector.<br/>The raw data, including any additional fields, is available to <a href="foi_requests_summary.csv">download here</a>.</p>
        <p><b>Disclaimer:</b><br/>This summary is generated from publicly available data from the listed sources.<br/>Due to variations in formatting, some data may be incomplete or inaccurate. Verify before using in reporting.<br/>FOI requests into Scottish LAs and other related organisations are included for wider reference—this may be narrowed to England-only LAs in future.<br/>For details on each request, use the active FOI request links in the table below.<br/></p>
        <p><p>LA colleagues are encouraged to share both <a href="mailto:datatoinsight@gmail.com?subject=FOI%20Feedback">feedback+corrections</a> or <a href="mailto:datatoinsight@gmail.com?subject=FOI%20details%20to%20add&body=Authority-Name:%20%3Cla-name%3E%0AAuthority-Code:%20%3Cla-code%3E%0ARequest-Title:%20%3Crequest-title%3E">submit new FOI request details</a> to contribute to this resource.</p></p>
