This site/dashboard provides a summary of Freedom of Information (FOI) requests published via the following sources:

- [whatdotheyknow.com](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/search/)
- [hastings.gov.uk](https://www.hastings.gov.uk/my-council/freedom-of-information/date/)
- <span style="color:grey;">[opendata.camden.gov.uk](https://opendata.camden.gov.uk/stories/s/Camden-Freedom-Of-Information-Response-Search/) PENDING </span>
- Local authority (colleague-)submitted records

## Remit
The creation of an automated/timely CSC resource for FOI requests, provides potential for proactive codified/sql response development, collaborative efforts towards develop once distribute 153x(with any other local authorities who receive similar requests) as well as providing a base for possible FOI data analysis/insights. 

## Overview
FOI requests are regularly submitted to multiple Local Authorities concurrently. The additional time-cost overheads on already stretched (data)teams often having impact into more critical BAU or insights reporting. By using the standardised SSD schema, the required query/code needed to generate the required FOI response data can be developed in cross-LA compatible manner; thus distributing(i.e minimising) the response overheads involved accross the sector. We (as D2I or sector colleagues) are then able to provide a pre-configured, zero cost, codified solution(as SQL, Python...) to any analyst/data team who might have also received the same or similar request.  Enabling them to download, run the pre-developed query and instantly produce from their data the needed supporting FOI response data where available. 

## Prerequisites
Local authorities will need to have deployed the [Standard Safeguarding Dataset (SSD)](https://data-to-insight.github.io/ssd-data-model/)
and/or be a contributor to this FOI Network in order to download any pre-developed response queries from the
[SSD tools repository](https://github.com/data-to-insight/ssd-data-model/tree/main/tools-ssd_foi_requests).
